<!-- Introduction -->

I challenged myself to re-create the magnificent 3D particle scene from the [Dala website](https://dala.craftedbygc.com/).

## Part 1: Setup the basic particles

In this section we'll explore a basic particles implementation with a custom vertex shader to animate the positions, and a fragment shader to dynamically style the points.

<!-- BasicParticles -->

## Part 2: Adding particles to the surface of the model

<!-- MeshParticles -->

- Sourced a nice low poly tree model from [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/laurel-tree-low-poly-f1a5baa9d2e24f27a98be75f23f38f35)

## Part 3: Animating particles between

<!-- FBOParticles -->

## Part 4: Pointer trail

## Final Result

```typescript

```

```jsx

```
